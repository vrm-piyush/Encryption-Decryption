## Overview

The Data Encryption and Decryption Tool is a web application developed using JavaScript that provides secure encryption and decryption functionalities using the AES-CBC (Advanced Encryption Standard - Cipher Block Chaining) algorithm. It supports localization using i18next for multi-language support, enhancing usability across different regions. The application ensures data security by implementing PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) for key derivation and AES-CBC for symmetric encryption.

## Features

Encryption and Decryption: Enables users to encrypt plain text messages and decrypt encrypted messages securely using AES-CBC.

Secure Key Management: Implements PBKDF2 for deriving encryption keys from passwords, enhancing security against brute-force attacks.

Localization: Supports multiple languages through i18next, allowing users to interact with the application in their preferred language.

Responsive Design: Built with a responsive design using HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.

User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface with interactive elements such as sliders for dark/light mode selection and language dropdown for localization.

Integration: Designed to integrate seamlessly into existing web applications, demonstrating interoperability and modularity.
